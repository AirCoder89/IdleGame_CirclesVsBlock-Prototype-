## How It Works

### Loading Script

The game begins with the Loading script, which is responsible for loading remote configuration settings to dynamically scale game formulas based on player progress.

### GameController

The `GameController` script serves as the central hub of the game, initiating the core gameplay loop. It contains a variety of settings that allow for customization of game elements, from visual effects handled by the shader controller to game mechanics.
